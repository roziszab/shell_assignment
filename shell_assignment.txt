1.1
Get-ChildItem:
I see the name of folders and files inside the working directory.

Get-Alias ls:
Tells me for which command the alias ls is a code for.
ls -> Get-ChildItem

1.2
The -Detailed version also includes parameters and examples

Add the option of Filter parameter and use *.txt to specify all files with the filename extension .txt.
Get-ChildItem -Filter *txt

2.1
Current working directory is C:\WINDOWS\system32
Command texts are yellows, strings are green

2.2
sl .. -> moves the directory back by one, to the mother directory
Set_Location can specify the working directory, such as the shell_magic directory in thsi case.

3.1
New-Item -Path . -Name "hello world"
Makes a new file in the wd.
I did not run into any problems while making this

3.2
New-Item -ItemType directory -Name "hello_world"
Makes a folder in the wd called hello_world

3.3
Making an empty file did not work, since this file was already made a couple steps before.
Making the new file: 			ni "hello_world.bfe"    
Rename it:				rni "hello_world.bfe" "hello_world.txt"
Moving file:				mi .\hello_world.txt -Destination .\hello_world
Moving it back:				mi .\hello_world\hello_world.txt
Changing wd:				sl .\hello_world
Moving file:				mi ..\hello_world.txt 
Moving it back:				mi .\hello_world.txt ..

3.4
Copying a file creates a duplicate of the original file, moving changes the location of one file.
(With the hello_world folder still as the working directory)
Copying item:				cpi ..\hello-world.txt
Copying and renaming item:			cpi ..\hello-world.txt .\world_hello

3.5
Moving back to the parent directory:		sl ..
Removing item:				rm .\hello_world.txt
Removing item in subdirectory		rm.\hello_world\hello_world.txt
Error message when removing folder:
The item at C:\Users\rozin\Documents\_UCU\DataAnalysis\week 2\day 1\shell_magic\hello_world has
children and the Recurse parameter was not specified. If you continue, all children will be removed
with the item. Are you sure you want to continue?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
Remove folder with contents:			rm ".\hello_world" then specified "Y"

4.1
New item					ni "hello_world.txt"
Printing output: 				gc ".\hello_world.txt"
There is no output, since the text file is empty, there is no content in it.

4.2 
write 'file contents' > file.txt
write 'more contents' >> file.txt

4.3
Making text file: 	 			gci C:\Users\rozin -r | write > .\home_contents.list
The | oh -p option helps so that the output will be printed by different directories, this is useful in case of a home directory with many subdirectories and files.

5.1
The Measure-Object command calculates the numeric properties of objects, and the characters, words, and lines in string objects, such as files of text.
Measure-Object cannot be used for file.txt	measure .\file.txt
However,					gc .\file.txt | measure -Word worked.
It gives the output 4.

The pipe operator can combine the commands, so the | oh -p used before only worked, because it already had a set it could execute its command on.
Measuring files in working directory:		gc | measure 
It gives the output 3.

5.2 
					write "hello world" "world hello" >> helloworld.txt
					sls "world" .\helloworld.txt
Output
helloworld.txt:1:hello world
helloworld.txt:2:world hello

					sls "world" *.txt
Output
helloworld.txt:1:hello world
helloworld.txt:2:world hello
worldhello.txt:1:world hello

with Select-Object we can select the coloumns such as Attributes, Name, Parent, etc.

5.3
cmd: 					sls "world" .\helloworld.txt
					sls "world" ".\helloworld.txt" | measure | oh -p

6.2
Unpacking: 				tar -xvzf .\aup.tar.gz

6.3
List:					gci .\aup\ -r
Deepest level that it goes to is a subdirectory of a subdirectory of the \aup directory, 
for example: .\aup\cohort3\s274f.
Opening a file to glimpse:			gc .\aup\cohort1\s003f\s003f.aup | oh -p
Counting the number of files:			gci .\aup\ -Filter *.aup -r | measure
There are 964 files with .aup extensions.

6.4
pipeline:					gci .\aup\cohort3\  -Filter *.aup -r | oh -p
measure files in cohort 3:			gci .\aup\cohort3\  -Filter *.aup -r | measure
measure files in cohort 1:			gci .\aup\cohort1\  -Filter *.aup -r | measure
ssc majors in cohort 2:			gci .\aup\cohort2\  -Filter *ssc.aup -r | measure
There are 19 Social Science Majors
redirect to list:				gci .\aup\cohort2\  -Filter *ssc.aup -r > ssc_cohort2.list
